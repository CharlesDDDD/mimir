    "MedQA": {
        "description": "MedQA is a large-scale, multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) dataset designed for medical student exam preparation. It contains over 10,000 questions from real medical exams, such as the USMLE. The dataset is unique in that it requires reasoning over multiple pieces of evidenceâ€”often a patient description, a summary of the patient's medical tests, and a short article about the relevant medical topic.",

    "MMLU Clinical Topics": {
        "description": "MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) is a new benchmark designed to measure knowledge acquired during pretraining by evaluating models exclusively in zero-shot and few-shot settings. The benchmark covers 57 subjects across STEM, the humanities, the social sciences, and more. It ranges in difficulty from an elementary level to an advanced professional level, and it tests both world knowledge and problem-solving ability.",

    "MedicationQA": {
        "description": "MedicationQA is a valuable dataset consisting of 674 question-answer pairs, meticulously annotated with information on question focus, type, and answer source. The research paper detailing MedicationQA follows a two-fold approach. Firstly, it outlines the manual annotation and answering process employed to construct the dataset. Subsequently, the paper delves into evaluating the performance of recurrent and convolutional neural networks in question type identification and focus recognition using the dataset. The study emphasizes its contribution of new resources and experimental insights into addressing consumers' medication-related inquiries. ",
